# nback
source code for basic nback game

This is a very basic version of the classic n-back memory game. I have coded it to run as a simple dual 2 back, with a 3x3 grid 
and two colors (red and blue). The check color/position/both code refernces array elements that are 3 before the current element, 
this is because by the time the user has pressed the match buttons, the gameFrame variable has already been incremented.
